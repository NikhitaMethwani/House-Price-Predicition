Abstract
The main aim of the notebbok is to predict house sale prices for King County.
Initial Analysis is done by plotting the outomes of the dataset to check the relationship between various independent and dependent variable(price).Seaborn and Matplotlib are the widely used libraries for plotting the data. The dataset contains many independent variables which have no direct relationship with the target ,therefore Feature selection is done to get the most important features (independent variables) Classification and Regression Techniques are used to model the data and train the model with the selected features. Pipeline and GridSearch Concept is used which automates the process and helps in fetching proper hyperparameter tunning models. We compare the Base models along with the models after Hyperparameter tunning and we find that the models perform better after hypertunning.
