Feature Engineering is done to check the impact of features on the target vatiable and various tecniques such as Heatmap , pairplots are used to understand the relationship between features and target variable.

Classification and Regression Techniques are used to model the data and train the model with the selected features. 

Pipeline and GridSearch Concept is used which automates the process and helps in fetching proper hyperparameter tunning models. We compare the Base models along with the models after Hyperparameter tunning and we find that the models perform better after hypertunning.
